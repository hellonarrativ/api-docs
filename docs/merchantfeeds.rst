Merchant Feeds
================

.. _merchantfeeds_overview:

Overview
--------

Narrativ provides the ability for our publisher partners to download merchant feeds in a standardized format for
monetization.  This enables product data to be integrated into your CMS, allowing for more control over monetization
decisions and integration of multi-button formats.

Feed Schema
-----------

**Please note**: all fields are nullable due to incomplete and/or inapplicable data. The feeds will
only include products that are in-stock at time of file generation.

Feed Delivery
-------------

Narrativ supports two methods of feed delivery:

**Amazon S3:**
Feeds will be delivered in a shared S3 bucket configured to have a sub-folder for each merchant.

If the publisher has their own AWS account, we will configure a shared S3 bucket that can be owned by either party.
Access will be managed using IAM roles.

If the publisher does not have their own AWS account, we will configure a shared S3 bucket accessed by secret key &
access key. Credentials will be shared in a 1pass vault for security purposes.

**SFTP:**
Feeds will be delivered to publisherâ€™s SFTP location.

Configuring the URLs
____________________

Product URLs contained in feed must be wrapped in our click wrapper (`Clickmate`_) before publishing to the site.
This ensures the link is properly monetized with Narrativ tracking appended on click.

Publisher JS Tag
________________

It is recommended to add our `Publisher JS Tag`_ for this integration method. The JSTag allows for real-time
optimization utilizing dynamic links and dynamic button displays as detailed in the linked documentation page.
Additionally, the JS Tag unlocks higher rates by enabling impressions tracking and post-impression attribution.
